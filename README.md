## 🧠 Project Overview
**DisasterConnect** is a simple **simulation-based software engineering project** that demonstrates how devices can communicate **offline** during natural disasters or network outages.  
It uses concepts inspired by **Bluetooth mesh networking** to allow messages to hop between nearby devices without internet connectivity.

This project is part of **CS 360 – Software Engineering**, focusing on **system design, UML modeling, and basic structure implementation**.
